Responsive Ranch Website

Used CSS Framework to generate a responsive version of the 7-Cross Hunting Ranch site. Bootstrap was used as the initial CSS Framework due to it being coverd in class. Materialize was also evaluated but opted to go with Bootstrap.

NavBar works nicely and mobile version looks good too. More work will be done to enhance this website in the next few weeks including adding some JavaScript in order to collect data on kills. Stay tuned.

I'll Be BACK!!
